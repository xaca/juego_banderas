# Fun with flags / Funny flags

This repository will be used to make a game of flags inspired by the program of the Big Bang Theory series, where the user can guess information about a country from the image of its flag.

For this we will use hacktoberfest to help collect information about the countries, we already have a first selection of flags that you can find in the image path:

[Images of flags](https://github.com/xaca/juego_banderas/tree/master/img)

We seek to complete a json file with the following information from each country, like this:

+ Name
+ Capital
+ Language
+ Image path (Reference the file name of the img folder)

## Instructions to participate

+ Review the list of countries in the img folder
+ Update the complete information of each country in the json file
+ Make at least 5 contributions to the archive with the country information
+ Follow the rules of the event code of conduct

## Issues
+ [Information of each country](https://github.com/xaca/juego_banderas/issues/1)
+ [Help with translation readme file](https://github.com/xaca/juego_banderas/issues/2)
